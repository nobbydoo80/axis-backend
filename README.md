## Setup and Usage for Development

The recommended way to run Axis services is now to use docker.  You can still run Axis (app) locally on a
Mac/Linux hardware OR as a container.  This setup will allow for both Axis to be run via docker and locally.  It
will also use docker for all of the services (mysql, rabbit, node, etc).
