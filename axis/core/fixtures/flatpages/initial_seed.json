As the program sponsor, APS will use the data collected to review and approve incentive payments.  \u201cAxis will allow us to collect not only energy simulation files and data but the complete ENERGY STAR\u00ae version 3 Thermal Enclosure checklists from Rater/Certification Organizations for homes in our program.   With Axis, we will have access to more comprehensive data to QA homes within our program,\u201d says Tom.  Axis supports incentive payment processing for program sponsors and invoice generation and tracking for Rater/Certification Organizations and HVAC contractors.  Axis also supports the RESNET sampling protocol to assist Certification Organizations with tracking sampling controls and creating sampling batches.  \u201cWe\u2019ve enjoyed working with the Pivotal team and look forward to our deployment of Axis in the coming months,\u201d Tom added.</p>",

If you have ever used the Axis user interface to provide checklist answers, then this applies to you. The enhancements will change the look of the checklist, but also allow us to give you more options for navigating the checklist and quickly answering the checklist questions.

Axis will be the first product to utilize Ekotrope's new general purpose application programming interface (API) to enable cloud-based simulations using the RESNET accredited Ekotrope engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pivotal's Axis platform is a cloud-based data collection, storage, and sharing solution used by HERS Raters and Certification Organizations, home builders, and energy efficiency program sponsors to streamline data collection for energy ratings and energy efficiency programs such as ENERGY STAR Homes.  By offering the Ekotrope engine from within Axis, Pivotal can offer HERS Raters the ability to enter preliminary rating data, generate a preliminary rating, validate and correct preliminary rating data from the field, generate a confirmed rating, and submit rating data to their Provider all from within a single, cloud-based platform.  The Axis/Ekotrope collaboration also provides energy efficiency programs an hourly-simulation option for the calculation of energy consumption and savings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By offering access to their cloud-based energy simulation engine, Ekotrope seeks to expand its market beyond new home builders into energy ratings to support HERS energy performance ratings and utility programs at a time when hourly simulation is becoming a requirement in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about Pivotal's Axis platform, go to <a href=\"https://pivotalenergysolutions.com\" target=blank>www.PivotalEnergySolutions.com,</a> or contact Bob Burns at 800-980-AXIS.

The NGBS Green stringent third-party verified certification process ensures that homes and apartments are built in compliance with the NGBS and focuses on three highly marketable attributes: healthy homes; lower operating costs; and sustainable lifestyle. NGBS Green homes must achieve high performance metrics in several key areas, including, site design, resource efficiency, water efficiency, energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building operation/maintenance. An NGBS Green Certified home can be awarded a Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Emerald certification level, depending on the number of green practices successfully incorporated in its design and construction.  And NGBS Green is the only national green home certification program that requires increasingly higher point thresholds in every category \u2013 not merely an increase in the overall points for the home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pivotal's Axis platform is a cloud-based energy rating data and workflow management solution used by HERS Raters and Certification Organizations, home builders, and energy efficiency program sponsors to streamline collection and sharing of energy ratings and program certifications. The consolidation of Axis data and Home Innovation\u2019s NGBS Green Certified home data furthers Pivotal\u2019s commitment toward proper valuation of energy-efficient homes by establishing Axis as a trusted data hub that facilitates data sharing within the energy efficiency industry and with multiple listing services (MLS) and other real estate market data systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to be working with Pivotal Energy Solutions,\u201d said Michael Luzier, president and CEO of Home Innovation. \u201cWe believe this partnership is well-timed to remedy two of today\u2019s most intractable market barriers when it comes to green homes \u2013 ensuring green certified homes receive the right valuation, and helping homebuyers and renters find them easily.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about Axis, go to <a href=\"http://www.PivotalEnergySolutions.com\" target=blank>www.PivotalEnergySolutions.com</a> or contact Bob Burns at 800-980-AXIS.
