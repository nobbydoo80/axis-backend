Hey Admins,

To update this account you are requested to open my MySQL connection in MySQL Workbench to

    {{ db_host }}:{{ db_port }}

using the admin account username '{{ db_user }}' and the correct password.

Once MySQL Workbench connects to {{ db_host }} please execute the following query:

    SET PASSWORD FOR '{{ username }}'@'%' = PASSWORD('{{ password }}');

Sincerely,

The AXIS Support Team
